<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p> 
Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaki, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn.  The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.

<h2>Why Play?</h2>

Studies have shown that playing games offers the opportunity to build and maintain cognitive skills when played consistently over time.  Additionally, playing games helps develop and maintain executive function skills.  One of those executive function skills, as mentioned in the title of this game, includes the skill of memory.
